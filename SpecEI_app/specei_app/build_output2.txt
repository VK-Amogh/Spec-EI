Your project is configured with Android NDK 27.0.12077973, but the following 
plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
- root_jailbreak_sniffer requires Android NDK 29.0.14033849
Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward 
compatible).
Add the following to 
D:\Startup\SpecEI\SpecEI_app\specei_app\android\app\build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        ndkVersion = "29.0.14033849"
        ...
